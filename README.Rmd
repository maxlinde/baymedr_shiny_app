# Shiny app for baymedr

This is a Shiny app implementation of the R package baymedr [@LindeVanravenzwaaij2019_0.1.0]. This Shiny app provides the same functionality as baymedr. However, no programming skills are required, which makes this Shiny app accessible for a large audience of researchers. baymedr and this Shiny app implementation allow researchers to easily calculate Bayes factors for superiority, non-inferiority, and equivalence designs. For that, either raw data or summary statistics can be used.

NOTE: Work in progress!
