The scale of the Cauchy prior is a parameter, which determines the spread of the distribution. For example, if the scale is $1$, then $50\%$ of the area under the Cauchy prior lies between $-1$ and $1$. The Cauchy prior scale can be used to set the range of plausible or interesting effect sizes. If only small effect sizes are expected, then a small Cauchy prior scale could be selected. In turn, if large effect sizes are expected, then a larger Cauchy prior scale could be chosen.

In many software packages, a default Cauchy prior scale of $1 / \sqrt{2} \approx 0.707$ is chosen. Other default values are $1$ and $\sqrt{2} \approx 1.414$. These values often provide good starting points. Ultimately, however, the chosen Cauchy prior scale should depend on the situation at hand.
