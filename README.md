# Shiny app for baymedr

This is a Shiny app implementation of the R package baymedr (Linde & van
Ravenzwaaij, 2019). This Shiny app provides the same functionality as
baymedr. However, no programming skills are required, which makes this
Shiny app accessible for a large audience of researchers. baymedr and
this Shiny app implementation allow researchers to easily calculate
Bayes factors for superiority, non-inferiority, and equivalence designs.
For that, either raw data or summary statistics can be used.

NOTE: Work in progress\!
